Officially launching [WeKeep][wekeep-home] today. WeKeep is an affordable bookkeeping service for online-first small businesses and startups in the GCC.

Here's how I came to believe there's an opportunity for a new type of bookkeeping service.

# Discovering accounting
In 2009 while in my first semester of business school, I had my first accounting class. I found the double-entry bookkeeping system pretty ingenious, and the ability to read financial statements pretty cool. I ended up enjoying accounting quite a bit. In my second year, I tutored first-year students, and got even better at the subject. Although I ended up majoring in finance, I wasn't even remotely considering making accounting a career. I liked technology instead, and I carried on in that field.
   
# UAE VAT
Fast forward a whole 8 years, late 2017, and I found myself having to set up the accounting system for my first startup to prepare for the upcoming VAT in the UAE. I contacted a few bookkeeping firms, but was left unimpressed with their service or their technology-literacy. The services they provide seemed antiquated, labor-intensive and expensive. And so instead, I decided to learn to use bookkeeping software myself, and write a short script that would sync our invoices from our database to our bookkeeping software. 
  
# How the idea finally came about
It was only a few months ago that I thought there may be an opportunity in the region for a modern, online-first bookkeeping service that understands what the new generation of digital entrepreneurs want. The introduction of VAT meant that for the first time businesses have to pay taxes, and so even the smallest businesses need to keep proper records to calculate how much VAT they owe the Federal Tax Authority. 

Initially, the idea was to build a new bookkeeping software that is much more small business owner-friendly. When I was learning to use the bookkeeping software we chose, I found it difficult to migrate from our Excel-based accounting and thought there must be a better way. Also, nearly everyone I've spoken to said they hated bookkeeping software, so I thought there may still an opportunity. 

But when I dug deeper, I wasn't able to put my finger on specific features that I thought would solve this problem for SMB owners in a reliable way. Owners want a hands-off approach to bookkeeping, with minimal input from their side, and the technology for complete automation is not there yet – human intervention is still needed. This is not about the software. It's about the service. 

And so with this conclusion <strong>I decided that WeKeep should be a turnkey bookkeeping service</strong>: it will provide a dedicated, human account manager and bookkeeper, and will augment the bookkeeper's work with software and automation to improve efficiency in the backend and reduce the price of the service. 

If you're a small business or a startup, [WeKeep][wekeep-home] may work for you. Feel free to [schedule a short chat][calendly-wekeep] with me.
