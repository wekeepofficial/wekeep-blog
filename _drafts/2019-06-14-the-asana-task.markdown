One of the things I struggle with as a solo founder is how to keep the momentum of effort going, especially early on when I was building the first version of WeKeep and I didn't have any customers. When you have a co-founder, you are accountable to each other so it's much easier. When you're on your own, it takes discipline and willpower to get things done.

Research suggests that procrastination comes from some unrecognized anxiety about the outcome of the task you want to do. For example, you're afraid you will fail, or the task is difficult. You are not consciously aware of that underlying anxiety, so the first thing you need to do when you notice you are procrastinating is:
-  **Articulate that feeling in _writing_.** "I'm avoiding the task because I feel I won't complete it quickly enough and it will make me feel like I'm not as smart as I think I am" â€“ or whatever is the real reason for you
- Once you recognize the feeling, either:
    - 1) **_talk your way_ out that this is not a reasonable excuse to avoid doing the task at hand**, or
    - 2) **spawn a new task to solve the newly identified problem.**
    
    For example, if the identified anxiety is "I'm afraid to fail at the task", talk your way out of it by saying to yourself: "how else will I achieve my goals if I don't try?", or if your fear is well-founded, create a new task, e.g. "Find someone who is more qualified to do the task". 
      
    
    Many of my own tasks right now are about creating new features for users. My underlying anxiety is "I'm afraid to be wasting my time developing these features that users will not find useful". This leads me to refocus on what _really needs_ to be done, rather than what I would _enjoy_ doing.  

- **Break down the task into smaller tasks in your to-do list, then _force yourself_ to start.** The trick about beating procrastination is to reduce the amount of willpower needed to the minimum by simplifying your task. There's no escape from _forcing yourself_ at some point, but the amount of willpower needed for that can be somewhat controlled by reformulating the task. If you break your task into a few, tiny tasks that take 5 minutes each, it will reduce the amount of willpower needed to get started ("this task will take just 5 minutes, I'll just do it and get it over with"). You can even break down the tasks when you're at the peak of procrastination, i.e. while you're potato-couching: open up your favorite to-do app, edit the task and break it down into subtasks. Very little willpower should be needed for that exercise.  
  

#### Set up a reminder
Like most self-help techniques, you will need regular reminders to apply the above steps before it becomes a habit. If you use Gmail, send yourself an email of the above steps once, then use the Snooze feature to bump the email back up on a weekly basis as a reminder.
